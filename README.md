# Obsidian Log Marker

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) designed for my personal use case. Typically I start every day by creating a new note with the current date. Then, throughout the day I note the current time and write what I am thinking about or working on. 

This way, instead of typing, I can press a button.

It will also switch focus to the current day's entry if a note already exists.
